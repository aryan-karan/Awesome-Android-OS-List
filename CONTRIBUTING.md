# How to contribute

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

I'm really glad you're reading this, because I need volunteers to help complete this List of Awesome Custom Android OS.

## Adding New Custom OS

For better organization of the list, I added an [_Issue_](https://github.com/rokibhasansagar/Awesome-Android-OS-List/issues/1) where you can give me the details of the new OS/ROM which is not already on the list.

Follow the guide there for inclusion of new OS/ROM.
